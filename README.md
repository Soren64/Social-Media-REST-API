# Social-Media-REST-API
This project was completed as part of a 12-week intensive software engineering training program with Revature. All content from the program (including the project itself) is under NDA and cannot be shared publicly.

# Overview

The project involved designing and implementing backend services and APIs, applying structured software engineering practices. Technologies included Java, SQL, RESTful APIs, and general software development lifecycle practices.

Two versions of the same API were made using different frameworks in Java:

1. Javalin
2. Spring Boot

While the source code cannot be shared publicly, I am happy to discuss:

Design, structure, and architecture

Testing, validation, and debugging approaches

Experience working using Git/GitLab

Project code review
